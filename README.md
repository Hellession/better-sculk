# Better Sculk Mod
A Minecraft Mod that rewards the farming of mobs with more yield.

This is the source code of my first Minecraft mod made in Fabric. Or at least the first mod I felt confident in sharing.

It is quite simple, though I needed to do some mixins to achieve the final result.
Probably not the best code, my experience with Java is quite sparse, even though I've been somewhat familiar with it throughout the years, so I hope it's not too bad.
